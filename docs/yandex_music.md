Looks like there is probably no official API.

Unofficial API: https://yandex-music.readthedocs.io/ru/main/

Official repo for player embedding https://github.com/yandex/audio-js/tree/master/spec.
From the first glance it works with links to tracks. Thus link-to-song correspondence might not be totally fixed.
Though, hardly it changes, at least not often.

Some linux app integrating different services. But I can't find any API usage there, maybe it works with just web pages.

Repo for yandex part (with no yandex page mentions): https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola-app-yandex-music.

Very old repo with python API https://github.com/nvbn/python-yamusic/.

Looks like a proper unofficial python API: https://github.com/MarshalX/yandex-music-api, https://pypi.org/project/yandex-music/, https://yandex-music.readthedocs.io/ru/main/

TypeScript unofficial API: https://github.com/acherkashin/yandex-music-extension
